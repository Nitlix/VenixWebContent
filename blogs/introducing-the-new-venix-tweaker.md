But what's new in this release you may ask, so let's get to the point:


<div class="bubble">Fresh look, Fresh Experience</div>

We were using the same code again and needed to change it up, so we have fully revamped our
tweaker with a slick new design and look.

<div class="bubble">Your Feedback, Our Improvements</div>

We've been listening to our community and our team has worked hard to make changes based on
your suggestions. We've added features you'll love and removed the ones you didn't find useful.

<div class="bubble">Easier Than Ever</div>

You don’t need to be worried about creating a backup anymore. Our latest version automatically
creates restore points and backs up your registry. No hassle, no stress – just a smoother experience
for you.

<div class="bubble">The power is in your hands</div>

Once installed, you're in complete control of what you want to apply. You apply the options which you
want to implement or not, its your preferences!
