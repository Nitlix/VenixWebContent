Good day Venix Lovers! We know some of you were confused about what happened and why our Discord Server has suddenly disappeared, and we'll answer it in this blog.
<br />

<div class="bubble">What Happened ðŸ¤”</div>

On the midday of December 25th our server was deleted, and most of the staff members' accounts were disabled. We suspect that someone spread disinformation about our tweaker containing malicous code, and that led to Discord pulling the false wrongful alarm on us.

<div class="bubble">But we're back ðŸ’ª</div>

Right after the events happened, we relocated to a new server and acquired the same vanity link we had before. <a href="https://discord.gg/tweaks">
  You can join the new server by clicking this.
</a> Our website or any accounts were not taken down. 
<br />

If you're an OG premium user, then please contact the staff team so that we can give you your roles back asap.

<br />
And of course... have a great XMas/New Years celebration and happy holidays! ðŸŽ„ðŸ¥³
<br />
<br />
